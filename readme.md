# Div-Slider

A js class for creating simple sliders for divs.

## Notes:

* The elements passed must not include different margin values. If they do include margin values pass these values to the constructor.

* Use smooth in slideRight/slideLeft to make animation smoother. But it should never be more than ms / n
